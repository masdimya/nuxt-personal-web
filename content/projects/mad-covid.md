# Mad Covid



My friend and I developed a WhatsApp bot designed to provide COVID-19 information specifically for the Bangkalan city area. This bot called MAD COVID. This bot serves as an information medium, delivering real-time updates on COVID-19 statistics and related news to users via WhatsApp. The application utilizes Python for data scraping, enabling it to gather the latest information from reliable sources. Flask is employed to create the web service that interacts with WhatsApp, allowing users to query and receive relevant COVID-19 information directly on their messaging platform. This application aims to enhance accessibility to critical pandemic information and promote public health awareness within the Bangkalan community.
