# Bangga - Bangkalan Smart City

Two years ago, my friend and I were given the opportunity to design the concept of a smart city in my hometown, Bangkalan, Indonesia. We focused on identifying the needs essential for building a smart city, aiming for the integration of all government sectors. This integration would allow both citizens and authorities to leverage data and potential resources effectively.

Initially, we proposed two systems and one mobile application. The first system was dedicated to tourism, serving as an informational platform for people to explore tourist attractions in Bangkalan. The second system focused on micro, small, and medium enterprises (UMKM), offering a platform for business owners to promote their products and gain visibility among the public. Additionally, we developed a mobile application serving as a portal and a comprehensive one-app solution. This application not only provided information on tourism and UMKM products but also included news updates, tax payment facilities, emergency contact numbers, and government document processing services.

In this project, I served as the technical lead and project manager. My responsibilities included designing tasks for team members and reviewing their work. This was my first experience overseeing the work of a team consisting of more than two individuals.
